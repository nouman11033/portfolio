here's who I am & what I do
Resume
Projects
I am a passionate student pursuing a engineering degree in Robotics and Automation, specializing in Data Science. My love for the field has driven me to continually explore and create more than
50+ projects across various domains.
​
To further expand my skills and competence, I am also pursuing a MicroMasters program from the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Data Science and Quantum Mechanics. The program has allowed me to dive deeper into the intricacies of these subjects and broaden my skill set.

Personal
have been a speaker at TEDx Junior in highschool


my highschool life journey We live in a world where it feels like we have the answer to everything, every problem, every equation, every thought, every impulse! ,but if you just take a step back and look, mankind is nothing but bound by boundaries to make sense of anything. we created countries to start small but still growth of livelihood and in the process found a way to separate every race and naming them as countries. We created leaders to rule out monarchy, to rule out so much power from a single person,so we divided them in leaders and got a group of people feeding on that power collectively and these boundaries even with a million problems have been unbroken for over centuries now here's the crazy part whenever we cross these very boundaries, mankind has had a breakthrough, from carts to electric automobiles, from leaves to making garments, we can create medicine in a million ways , we can even generate electricity in a million ways, we've made laws in these subjects too ?! created boundaries too ?! and yet broke them to find new subjects,new laws ,new theories,new vision because one thing this mankind can't put boundaries on is our imagination ,this is the world i believe in or as long as I can remember I've wanted to pursue 'the next step' or be held responsible for 'the next big thing', and I feel that the passion of breaking some boundaries in order to create something new is important. In the future I don't want to be remembered as someone who was inspired by him/her I want to be the one who inspired; for this very reason, I have never wanted to become the next Steve Jobs or the next Bill Gates instead i want to become someone like the next Richard Feynman like yeah Bill Gates is extraordinary but in an ordinary way. I have had one hell of a ride of collecting numerous medals and certificates throughout my high school years from every science fair i could take part in ,with  my most peculiar but unique science projects like virtual holograms ,using pezosensors to create a walkable path which generates green renewable electricity to book writing and reading competitions from 6 debates to 7 MUN's (with committees like UNSC UNICEF and DISEC)  to numerous speeches and elocutions on many festive's as a prefect throughout my freshman to senior year. I was big on words having an opinion and point of view about anything i could rap my head around .Apart from being a remarkable nerd ,i have also played athletics for my school for 4 years including the school football team for 2 . The one subject I've been keyed to in these 18 years is physics, i finished anything and everything about my hero Richard Feynman by the age of  14 and summed up every eccentric unknown fact on this planet about physics or aerodynamics like the 'Beacon Of Maracaibo' or 'The Night Of The Northern Lights' .I've come to major blows with a bunch of my teachers about questions and theories which can't have promising answers or appear exceptionally strange like how pi shows up on collisions of 2 bodies (elastically + mass between bodies is 1 : 10^N) or how string theory can have knots in it .I've also achieved deep learning of computer science with complete commands on languages like C++ and Java up to an intermediate level. Even after achieving to ranks like a certificated ethical hacker with kali Linux and testing expert. I've always had a crave for more like how the 21st-century humans have evolved in technology because dont we know it technology is the greatest achievement of humans by far my achievements are not why i am demanding for an admission, its my questions why i want a bachelor's degree from the United Kingdom (UK). To seek knowledge from great minds and appliances with guidance to every one of those questions through my 4 years of graduation .I cannot wait for the opportunity to surround myself in the subject I feel so passionate about next year, and look forward to the challenges that the university will bring upon on me cause ,I am extraordinary but in an extraordinary way ! .
